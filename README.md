# Frontend Reboot

I have been writing HTML, CSS and JS for a couple of years. Many basic and advance ways to solve the problem has come and gone. In fact, I have never started from the actual basic of the language properly. It's good to do something like this once in a while as I can gather all the familiar things together.

This will be a collection of my familiar but never really use stuffs such as Gulp, vanilla JS to manipulate HTML, SCSS, ~~jQuery~~ and more. I hope this will help strengthening my frontend knowledge and skill more or less ðŸ˜¬
